Changes to R2WinBUGS:
=====================

During the process of packaging R2WinBUGS_0.1 - R2WinBUGS_0.2-1, 
quite a lot of changes had been made. Those changes are not 
documented anywhere ...


Update 0.2-2 (28 Apr 2004):
- schools data: original (see references) instead of the rounded data

Update 0.2-3 (10 Sept 2004):
- bugs.data.inits split to bugs.inits and bugs.data, the latter exported
  from the Namespace.
  Now we can use already written data files in bugs().
